# COPPk-means_new

Include datasets that will be operated on to make this library self-contained. Old version without datasets is at https://github.com/JohnJimAir/COPPk-means.

The executable main file is at `COPPk-means/cmd/main_elaborate/main.go`, and the mini-batch k-means version is at `COPPk-means/cmd/main_minibatch/main.go` in this library.
